## 🎆 More About Me 🎆 ##
I’ve built web, mobile, and desktop solutions using React, Node.js, Electron, Docker, AWS, and GCP. At CSAA Insurance Group, I optimized data pipelines by transitioning jobs to AWS EMR Serverless and validating workflows with Snowflake. For my senior design project, my team and I engineered a proof-of-concept real-time collaboration app with Expo, WebRTC, React Native, and open-source libraries, designed for compatibility with our sponsor company’s screen reader. I’m seeking new grad full-stack or software engineering roles where I can contribute to impactful products and grow with a collaborative team!
